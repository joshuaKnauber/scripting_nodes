# Nodes

Scripting Nodes provides a variety of node categories to help you build complete Blender add-ons.

## Categories

### Interface

Create UI elements like panels, menus, and pie menus for your add-on.

### Logic

Control flow nodes for conditionals, loops, and branching logic.

### Data

Access and manipulate Blender data including objects, meshes, materials, and more.

### Math

Mathematical operations for calculations and transformations.

### Groups

Organize your node trees with reusable node groups.

## Adding Nodes

Press **Shift+A** in the node editor to open the add menu and browse available nodes by category.

## Root Nodes

Some nodes are marked as "root nodes" - these are entry points that trigger your add-on's functionality. Examples include:

- **Operator nodes**: Define custom operators
- **Panel nodes**: Create UI panels
- **Handler nodes**: Respond to Blender events

Root nodes are the starting point for code generation. Connect other nodes to them to build your add-on's logic.
