# Introduction

Scripting Nodes is a visual scripting add-on for Blender 4.3+ that lets you create Blender add-ons through node graphs that generate Python modules.

## Features

- **Visual Scripting**: Build add-ons using an intuitive node-based interface
- **Code Generation**: Automatically generates clean Python code from your node graphs
- **Live Preview**: See changes in real-time as you build your node trees
- **Full Blender Integration**: Access all of Blender's Python API through nodes
