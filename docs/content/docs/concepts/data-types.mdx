# Data Types

Scripting Nodes uses a type system to ensure connections are valid and data flows correctly.

## Socket Colors

Socket colors indicate the type of data they carry:

| Color | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 🟢 Green | Program | Execution flow |
| 🔵 Blue | Value | Numbers, strings, booleans |
| 🟣 Purple | Object | Blender objects |
| 🟡 Yellow | Collection | Lists and arrays |
| ⚪ Gray | Any | Accepts multiple types |

## Program Flow

The green **program sockets** are special—they control *when* code runs, not *what* data it uses. Think of them as the "execution order" of your script.

## Automatic Conversion

Many data types convert automatically:

- Integers ↔ Floats
- Numbers → Strings
- Single values → Lists

When automatic conversion isn't possible, you'll see a warning and the connection won't be made.

## Type-Specific Nodes

Some nodes only work with specific types. For example:

- **Math nodes** work with numbers
- **String nodes** work with text
- **Object nodes** work with Blender objects

The Add menu organizes nodes by category to help you find type-appropriate nodes.
