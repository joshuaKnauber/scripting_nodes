# Code Generation

Scripting Nodes generates clean, readable Python code from your node graphs. Understanding this process helps you debug issues and learn Blender's Python API.

## How It Works

1. **Parse**: The node tree is analyzed to understand data flow
2. **Order**: Nodes are sorted by dependency (inputs before outputs)
3. **Generate**: Each node outputs its Python code snippet
4. **Combine**: Snippets are assembled into a complete module
5. **Format**: The code is cleaned up and formatted

## Viewing Generated Code

To see the Python code your nodes produce:

1. Open the sidebar with **N**
2. Look for the **Code** panel
3. Toggle **Show Code** to see live output

This is a great way to learn Blender's Python API!

## Development vs Production

Scripting Nodes has two modes:

### Development Mode
- Code updates instantly as you edit
- Includes debug information
- Optimized for iteration speed

### Production Mode
- Clean, optimized output
- Ready for distribution
- No development overhead

Switch modes in the add-on preferences or when exporting.

## Code Quality

Generated code follows Python best practices:

- PEP 8 formatting
- Clear variable names
- Proper Blender API usage
- Appropriate error handling
