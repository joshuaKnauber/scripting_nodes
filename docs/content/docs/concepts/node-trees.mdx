# Node Trees

Node trees are the foundation of Scripting Nodes. Each tree is an independent script that gets compiled into Python code.

## Creating Node Trees

Create a new node tree using the **New** button in the editor header, or duplicate an existing one for quick iteration.

## Organization

You can have multiple node trees in a single Blender file. Consider organizing by functionality:

- One tree per operator
- One tree for all UI panels
- One tree for shared utilities

## The Node Tree Interface

The header provides quick access to:

- **Tree selector**: Switch between node trees
- **Add menu** (Shift+A): Insert new nodes
- **View controls**: Zoom, pan, and frame selection

## Live Compilation

As you work, Scripting Nodes continuously compiles your node tree in the background. This means:

- Changes are reflected immediately
- Errors are caught as you build
- You can test without explicit "run" steps

## Frames and Comments

Use **Frame nodes** to group related nodes together. Add **Comment nodes** to document your logic for future reference.
