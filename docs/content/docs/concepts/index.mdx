# Concepts

Understanding these core concepts will help you get the most out of Scripting Nodes.

## Node Trees

A **node tree** is a container for your visual script. Each node tree represents a self-contained piece of functionality, like an operator, a panel, or an entire add-on.

Node trees are listed in the header dropdown and can be organized however you prefer.

## Nodes

**Nodes** are the building blocks of your scripts. Each node performs a specific function:

- **Input nodes** provide data (numbers, strings, objects)
- **Logic nodes** make decisions (if/else, loops)
- **Action nodes** do things (create objects, modify properties)
- **Output nodes** define results (return values, UI elements)

## Sockets and Connections

Nodes communicate through **sockets**:

- **Input sockets** (left side) receive data
- **Output sockets** (right side) send data

Connect sockets by dragging from one to another. Colors indicate compatible types:
- 🟢 Green: Program flow (execution order)
- 🔵 Blue: Data values
- 🟡 Yellow: Objects and references

## Program Flow

The **green program sockets** control execution order. Unlike data connections that can branch freely, program flow typically moves in sequence from top to bottom, left to right.
