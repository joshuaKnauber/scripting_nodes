# Logic Nodes

Logic nodes control the flow of your program based on conditions.

## Conditions

### If
Executes different code paths based on a condition.

**Inputs:**
- **Condition**: Boolean value to check
- **Program**: When to evaluate

**Outputs:**
- **True**: Executed when condition is true
- **False**: Executed when condition is false

### Switch
Selects one of multiple paths based on a value. Like a multi-way if statement.

### Compare
Compares two values and outputs a boolean.

**Operations:**
- Equal `==`
- Not Equal `!=`
- Greater Than `>`
- Less Than `<`
- Greater or Equal `>=`
- Less or Equal `<=`

## Loops

### For Loop
Repeats code a specific number of times.

**Inputs:**
- **Start**: Beginning value
- **End**: Ending value
- **Step**: Increment amount

**Outputs:**
- **Loop Body**: Executed each iteration
- **Index**: Current iteration number
- **Completed**: Executed after all iterations

### While Loop
Repeats code while a condition remains true.

### For Each
Iterates over items in a collection.

## Flow Control

### Sequence
Executes multiple program paths in order.

### Gate
Blocks or allows program flow based on a condition.

### Delay
Pauses execution (use with caution in UI contexts).
