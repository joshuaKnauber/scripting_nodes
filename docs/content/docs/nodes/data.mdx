# Data Nodes

Data nodes let you store, retrieve, and manipulate data in your scripts.

## Properties

### Property

**Types:**
- Boolean (checkbox)
- Integer (whole number)
- Float (decimal number)  
- String (text)
- Enum (dropdown selection)
- Pointer (reference to Blender data)

### Get Property

### Set Property

## Variables

### Get Variable

### Set Variable

## Data Access

### Get Attribute

### Set Attribute
